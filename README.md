### Using Spoofer with cheats
- **First run the cheat**, then run our HWID Spoofer.

## Features
- **Temporary removal of the hardware ban**: Works until the PC restarts.
- **Clearing the ban history**: Removes traces of previous bans.
- **Bypass shadow bans**: Use the built-in cleaner for Call of Duty games.
- **Recommendation**: Use Spoofer only on **a new account** that was not previously blocked.
- **Troubleshooting**: If the cleaner does not work, we recommend **reinstalling Windows**.

\*For games marked with an asterisk, you must use the **built-in cleaner** to remove all traces left after receiving the ban. This will allow you to bypass shadow bans without having to reinstall Windows.
